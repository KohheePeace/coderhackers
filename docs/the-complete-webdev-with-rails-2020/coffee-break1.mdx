This is a coffee break chapter. ☕

## Is **jQuery** outdated or dead?

=> No.

## Why I choose jQuery in this course ?

1. Easy for beginners.
2. It is enough to make an MVP

## What do you think about React.js or Vue.js etc...?

You **should** learn react.js or vue.js **if you want to become professional web developer**.

**<mark>But the goal of this course is to make an MVP.</mark>**

If your MVP get attention after launch, then hire professional frontend engineer (\*if needed).

(It is easy for professional frontend engineer to replace it because they of course know jQuery).

## Template

:::note

- Famous website CSS is really complex.
- After you finish this course, choose one of theme of this site (https://startbootstrap.com/themes/)
