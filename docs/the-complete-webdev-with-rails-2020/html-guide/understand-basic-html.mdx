## Overview

In this chapter, we are going to

- Understand last chapter HTML code
- Acquire the habit of googling

## Check the meaning of the HTML code

:::important
The most important thing is always **googling!**
:::

This is the code we used in the last chapter.

```html title="test1.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Content of the document......
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's check this code from top to bottom.

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`

Let's google "**what is doctype in html**"

I choose this link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/

> A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction which tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. The Doctype is not an element or tag, <mark>it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML</mark> or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

So, if you want to use **`HTML 4.01 Strict`** version...

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

### 2. `<head>`

Let's google **"what is head tag of html"**

> The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag.
> HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. **Metadata is not displayed.**
> Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
> The following tags describe metadata: `<title>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, and `<base>`.

### 3. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

Let's google **"meta charset=UTF-8"**

> The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_meta_charset.asp

According to the below link, charset can be...

:::note

- **UTF-8**: It specify the character encoding for Unicode.
- **ISO-8859-1**: It specify the character encoding for the Latin alphabet.

:::

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-meta-charset-attribute/

If you change the charset and add content like below...

It does not display correctly.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- highlight-next-line -->
    <meta charset="ISO-8859-1" />
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Бзиа збаша (Bzia zbaşa), Фэсапщы, Ç'kemi, ሰላም, and even right-to-left
    writing such as this السلام عليكم
  </body>
</html>
```

Always using **`UTF-8`** is enough.

> The `<body>` tag defines the document's body.
> The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
