In this chapter, we are going to

- Understand last chapter HTML code
- Acquire the habit of googling

## Check the meaning of the HTML code

:::important
The most important thing is always **googling it!**
:::

This is the code we used in the last chapter.

```html title="test.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Content of the document......
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's check this code from top to bottom.

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`

Let's google "**what is doctype in html**"

I choose this link https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp

> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.

> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; <mark>**it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.**</mark>

So, if you want to use HTML4 version...

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

### 2. `<head>`

Let's google **"what is head tag of html"**

> **<mark>the `<head>` tag is used to contain specific information about a web page</mark>**, often referred to as metadata.

### 3. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

Let's google **"meta charset=UTF-8"**

> The HTML charset Attribute is used to specify the character encoding for the HTML document.

According to the below link, charset can be...

```
- UTF-8: It specify the character encoding for Unicode.
- ISO-8859-1: It specify the character encoding for the Latin alphabet.
```

If you change the charset and add content like below...

It does not display correctly.

```html hl_lines="9"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="ISO-8859-1" />
    <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    Бзиа збаша (Bzia zbaşa), Фэсапщы, Ç'kemi, ሰላም, and even right-to-left
    writing such as this السلام عليكم
  </body>
</html>
```

> The HTML `<body>` tag defines the main content of the HTML document or the section of the HTML document <mark>that will be directly visible on your web page.</mark>
