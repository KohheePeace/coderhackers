## Absolute Path
Absolute path is **exact location of your file** in your PC.

Something like

```
file:///C:/Users/kohheepeace/Desktop/html-test/test1.html
```

## Relative Path
If you see `test2.html` from `test1.html`, `test2.html` is located in same directory hierarchy.

This is why you can link `test2.html` just like
```html
<a href="test2.html">Go to test2.html</a>
```
