## What next ?
There are things you cannot do with only frontend.

- Save data persistently
- How to login or logout
- Send Email
- Payment system

etc...

To accomplish these requirements, we need to learn backend.

We will choose **Ruby** and it's framework **Ruby on rails** to implement backend.
