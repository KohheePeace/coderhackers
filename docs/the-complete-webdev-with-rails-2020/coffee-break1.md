This is a coffee break chapter. ☕

## Is **jQuery** outdated or dead?

=> No.

## Why I choose jQuery in this course ?

1. Easy for beginners.
2. It is enough to make an MVP product.

## What do you think about React.js or Vue.js etc...?

You **should** learn react.js or vue.js **if you want to become a professional web developer**.

**<mark>But the goal of this course is to make an product.</mark>**

If your MVP product get attention after launch, then hire professional frontend engineer (*if needed).

It is easy for professional frontend engineer to replace your website because they of course know jQuery.
