Ref: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal

`terminal`
```bash
flutter create flutter_firebase_firestore_crud2a
cd flutter_firebase_firestore_crud2a
flutter run
```

But you need to press
1. "r" => for hot reloading
2. "R" => for hot restart

If you want to reload when you save code you need to start debugging.

Or press `cmd + shift + F5`.
